# FED Assignment 1 - S10255626K - Darius Koh

Creating a website for a Japanese singer: Ado.
 
## Design Process

As someone who did not really look at content from Ado much, I decided to explore artists that I typically did not listen to, so as to look for different kinds of music to enjoy.

Eventually, I decided to base my website around Ado, as I enjoyed a few of her songs, but never listened to her music much.

When thinking about what to include in my website, I thought of what someone who did not know the artist would like to find out:
- Who exactly is Ado?
- What genre does she perform in?
- What are some of her songs?
- Does she have any tours near me?

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- A home screen that scrolls down to an about me section
- A page to show all current tours (Ado's world tour hasn't been announced at the time of writing, so I entered placholder values)
- A page to show all her current songs (that I found on spotify, as many Japanses artists may not post all their songs there, the list may be incomplete)
- A demo shop, with dummy blank items

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
In the future, if I decide to pick this project back up again, I may be able to build:
- A working shopping cart (I tried making it, but ran into many issues so I scrapped the idea.)
- More working links and linking to all her shows (Can use an API connection)

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- HTML - Base Website Structure
- CSS - Design and Styling + Animations
- JavaScript - Logic
- AdobeXD - Wireframe
- Visual Studio Code - Programming
- GitHub - Version Control and Hosting
